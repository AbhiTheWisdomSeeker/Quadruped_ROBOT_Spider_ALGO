Components of the Spider Robot

So this is A Quadruped Spider Robot Project. where it's Main Components were SG90 Servo moters and Arduino nano.Nano is the Brain 

So this SpiderROBOT is Working On sequential Order of Algos Made Using the Invers Kinematics .


Right Now This Repo Contains 2 files 1-Is for the the checking of 90Â° Correct angles of Servo and the Working of Boards and overall Connections 
                                     2-Is the main Source Code and Is what Driving the Spider....
