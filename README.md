# Quadruped Spider Robot

This project is about a Quadruped Spider Robot, where its main components are SG90 Servo Motors and an Arduino Nano, which acts as the brain of the robot.

## Components

- SG90 Servo Motors
- Arduino Nano

## Working Principle

The spider robot operates based on a sequential order of algorithms created using inverse kinematics.

## Basic Functions

The spider robot can perform the following basic functions:
- Forward Movement
- Backward Movement
- Turns Left
- Turns Right
- Says "Hi"

## Files

1. **Spider90**: This file is used for checking the correct angles of the servos (90Â°) and to verify the working of boards and overall connections.

2. **SpiderSome.ino**: This is the main source code that drives the spider robot.

## How to Use

- Upload the `Spider90` sketch to verify the servo angles.
- Upload the `SpiderSome.ino` sketch to drive the spider robot.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
